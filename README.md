# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Dev 1 - Linear Regression to Predict](https://github.com/Robeliom15/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Dev%201%20-%20Linear%20Regression%20to%20Predict%20MPG.png?raw=true)

- The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance show some likelihood of non-random amounts of variance to the model. Additionally, these two will have a big impact on the mpg (miles per gallon) for the prototype. 

- Looking at the p-value of 5.35e-11 which is below the significance level of 0.05%. This shows that we have enough evidence to reject then null which shows us that the linear model is not zero. 

- The linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149 or 71%. This shows that the models do predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
